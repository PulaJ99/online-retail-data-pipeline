# Project Log – Retail Data Pipeline

## Day 1 – Repo setup
What I did:
- Created a new GitHub repo
- Added README
- Set up folder structure

Why:
- Keep this project independent and interview-ready

Notes:
- Git does not track empty folders → used .gitkeep
- .venv is local only and ignored

---

## Day 2 – Environment + data setup
What I did:
- Created Python virtual environment
- Added .gitignore rules
- Downloaded dataset (kept local)

Why:
- Isolate dependencies
- Avoid committing large or licensed data
